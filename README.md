GIPMed - 234329

This project is taken in prof. Roni Kimmel's lab of geometric image processing - GIP lab of the CS faculty in Technion. 
The aim of this project is to build a deep learning-based model for automatic segmentation of tissue (against background) inside a Whole Slide Image (WSI) of a biopsy - taken from breast cancer patients. The biopsy is stained with H&E staining method.
We aim to outperform the classic method –OTSU’s method-  that is used today, without any further adaptations on different sets of data.

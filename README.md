This project is taken in Geometric Image Processing - GIP lab of the CS faculty in Technion. 

In this study, we investigate the use of deep learning models for the semantic segmentation of H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) images. H&E images are commonly used in pathology for the diagnosis and analysis of tissue samples, and automated segmentation can aid in the accurate and efficient identification of different structures within these images. We trained and tested several deep learning models, including U-Net, in a supervised manner on datasets of H&E images that include foreground tissue segmentation performed by the OTSUâ€™s thresholding method. We evaluated their performance using various metrics. Our results show that deep learning models can achieve high accuracy in the semantic segmentation of H&E images, along with being robust to changing the type, color, shape, and texture of the tissue, making them promising tools for use in medical image analysis tasks.
